New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.4.4:

* Bumped CC:T version to 1.93.0
* Added computer size counting to `fs.getFreeSpace`
  * This is only enabled with `standardsMode` on
  * Without `standardsMode`, old behavior is kept
  * May reduce performance of `fs.getFreeSpace`
* Fixed path resolution on Windows systems using non-ASCII characters in paths
  * This involved rewriting all of the path-related code to accept wide strings on Windows
    * Why did Windows have to keep using UTF-16??? >:(
* Fixed keyboard layouts not being respected (#138)
* Fixed string pattern matching with NUL bytes in patterns
  * This was previously done in the default ROM, but now Lua itself has been modified to fix the issue
  * Alternate ROMs (such as the CC:T ROM) no longer have this issue
* Fixed automatic directory creation reversing the new directory names (#137)
* Fixed some crashes related to the printer
* Fixed HTTP >= 400 response codes not being returned as failures
* Fixed `terminate` event not being sent unconditionally when a filter is set
* `term.screenshot` can now be called with a boolean value specifying whether to copy the image to the clipboard
* Added error message to `periphemu.create`
* Fixed name of scripts run through `wget`
* Added some extra argument checks to `shell` functions in `cash`
* Fixed `__tostring` metamethod missing from `cc.pretty` objects
* Fixed standalone CI builds
