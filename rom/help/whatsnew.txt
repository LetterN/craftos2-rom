New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.4.5:

* Bumped CC:T version to 1.93.1
  * 1.94.0 support will be coming in v2.5
* CC:T Edition builds will now update to the standard ROM due to deprecation in v2.5
  * v2.5 is merging the CC:T ROM into the main ROM, so CC:T Edition downloads will be removed
  * Further auto-updates will download the standard version regardless of whether CC:T Edition was installed
  * v2.5 will be the last version with a CC:T Edition download available - after that, updating from CC:T Edition will fail
* Added some previously missing checks from `term` API functions
* Fixed `term.setGraphicsMode(false)` not working properly
* Fixed a possible crash in `file.readLine` on empty lines
* Fixed a memory leak in `os.startTimer`
* Fixed `ccemux.openDataDir` not working on Windows
* Fixed monitor_touch events not being sent when monitorsUseMouseEvents is disabled
* Fixed update message appearing when switching between standard and Accelerated versions
