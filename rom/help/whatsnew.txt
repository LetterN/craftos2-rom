New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.3:

* Massively improved performance of emulation
  * Speed issues are caused by the debugger's hooks (specifically line hooks)
  * This version only enables the required hooks depending on what features are required
  * In general, more debugging features -> lower performance
  * Depending on the machine, expect between 4-20x faster emulation
* Added official support for WASM, including an online client (CraftOS-PC Online)
  * CraftOS-PC Online is available at https://www.craftos-pc.cc/online/
  * Supports Chrome/Chrome-based browsers, and new versions of Firefox with the following options enabled in `about:config`:
    * `javascript.options.shared_memory`
    * `dom.postMessage.sharedArrayBuffer.withCOOP_COEP`
    * `browser.tabs.remote.useCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy`
    * `browser.tabs.remote.useCrossOriginOpenerPolicy`
* Added speaker peripheral
  * Includes open-source sounds for notes
  * Users can manually add in custom sounds (including offical Minecraft ones)
    * See https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/periphemu.html#speaker-sounds for more info
* Updated CC:T compatibility to 1.87.1
  * Added `fs.getAttributes` and `fs.getCapacity` functions
  * Added optional timeout argument to `websocket.receive`
  * Ported pretty printer to `lua.lua`
  * Added `__len` metamethod for tables
  * Strings now accept `\xNN`, `\u{NNN}`, and `\z` escape codes
  * Added `utf8` library
  * Added base argument to `math.log`
  * Moved `table.pack` and `table.unpack` out of the ROM and into C
  * Added `textutils.unserializeJSON`
  * Rewrote `settings` API
  * Enabled MOTD by default
  * `http.post` now accepts a table as an argument as expected

  * See the documentation (https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/rawmode.html) for more info
* Added TRoR (Terminal Redirect over Rednet) terminal renderer
* Added the ability to place modems on multiple separate networks
  * This can be done by adding a third argument when attaching the peripheral, specifying the network ID
  * Modems with different network IDs won't be able to communicate with each other
* Added prompt when mounting a real directory, for security
  * This is to mitigate the possibility that a malicious script deletes arbitrary files
  * A prompt also appears when changing the `mount_mode` option
  * To disable this (not recommended), set `showMountPrompt` to false in global.json
    * This option cannot be changed inside CraftOS-PC
* Added filesystem merge mount support
* Added standalone executable option for Windows & Linux
* Added scrollback to debugger console
* Added pop-up when a computer is hung and ignores terminate events

* Fixed memory leak when taking a screenshot on Mac
