New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.3.4:

* Updated CC:T version to 1.89.1
  * This includes full testing on the CC:T test set
  * CraftOS-PC now fully passes all CC:T tests

  * The dialog includes a message describing where the JSON parsing error occurred

  * `--assets-dir`, `--computers-dir`, `--start-dir`, `--data-dir` (alias of `--directory`), `--plugin`, `--renderer`
