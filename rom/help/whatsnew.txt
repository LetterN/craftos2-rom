New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.4.2:

* Updated CC:T version to 1.91.0
  * Add string.{pack,unpack,packsize} (MCJack123)
  * Escape non-ASCII characters in JSON strings (neumond)
  * Make field names in fs.attributes more consistent (abby)
  * Fix textutils.formatTime correctly handle 12 AM (R93950X)
* Speakers are now emulated closer to how they work in ComputerCraft
  * Each speaker has its own channel pool
  * Channels are allocated as needed
  * The `maxNotesPerTick` option now properly caps notes every 1/20 s
  * Only one sound can be played at once
  * Channel numbers are now returned as a second argument
    * These can be passed to `stopSounds` to stop one channel
* Replaced custom bit32 library with standard Lua 5.2 implementation
  * This fixes a bug where functions can't take more than two arguments
  * This should also fix any other possible bugs in the bit32 library
* Fixed yielding from callbacks of certain functions:
  * `string.gsub`
  * `table.sort`
  * debug hooks
  * The only function that can't yield from a callback is `load`
* Added `--mc-save` argument to load computers from a Minecraft save
  * This reads from the default Minecraft save directory
  * If the save isn't stored there, you can't use this argument (use `--computers-dir` instead)
* Added date-specific MOTDs
  * One of these appears today (September 8)!
* Added support for hardware renderer in raw client mode
* Functions can now return an unlimited* number of values
* Updated cash to use `cc.require` module
* Fixed a bug causing the same MOTD to appear on each boot
* Fixed a bug causing a failure to connect to `localhost` over HTTP
* Fixed a bug with the \x escape code
* Modified internals of plugin loader, fixing a memory leak in the process
* JIT: Updated LuaJIT to 2.1.0-beta3
* JIT: Moved plugin path back to `plugins-luajit` as expected
* JIT: Added FFI library (available with `jit_ffi_enable` set to true)
* JIT: Removed `os.setHaltOnLongRunMode`, count hooks are no longer used
* JIT: Fixed a bug causing `io.read` to not work
* Windows: Added error dialog when using console-only options with non-console builds
* Mac: Application is now built as a Universal binary (excluding CraftOS-PC Accelerated, as LuaJIT does not fully support ARM64 yet)
