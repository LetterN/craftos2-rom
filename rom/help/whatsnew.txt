New Features in CraftOS-PC v2.5.3:

* Added automatic crash log uploading behind `snooperEnabled`
  * A prompt will appear on first boot asking to allow this
  * See https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/privacy for info about how your data is kept secure
* Added `snooperEnabled` config setting
  * This is currently only used for crash uploading, but more (very basic) analytics may be added in the future
* The `debug` API is now enabled by default
  * This is possible due to the `debug` API no longer requiring hooks
  * The availability of `debug` resolves a long-standing compatibility issue when run with the default config
* Bumped structure version to 2
  * New fields in `configuration`:
    * `snooperEnabled`
  * New fields in `PluginFunctions`:
    * `registerConfigSetting`
  * New fields in `Terminal`:
    * `mouseButtonOrder`
* Added new `registerConfigSetting` capability to allow access to plugin settings from `config` API
* Added ability to yield from line and count hooks
* Debug hooks now work as expected when no debugger is attached
  * This breaks `logErrors` and non-debugger breakpoints, but neither feature is used much
    * They may be brought back in the future, but they are not working for now
* Functions passed to `load` can now yield in standards mode only
  * This is behind standards mode due to the possible performance hit being higher than its usefulness
* Decreased mixer chunk size to 512
  * This should help with latency in things like the [sound plugin](https://gist.github.com/MCJack123/34ae1ca1a962504f32b34f2771f92326)
* Fixed HTTP handles not being closed when going out of scope/being deleted
* Fixed deadlock/high memory usage when resizing window to 0x0
* Fixed DPI issues in hardware renderer on Mac when switching between Retina and non-Retina displays
* Fixed deadlock when maximizing window with `snapToSize` enabled
* Fixed mouse buttons > 3 being returned as 1
* Mouse buttons > 3 no longer report in standards mode
* Fixed the order of mouse buttons reported with mouse_drag when multiple are down at the same time
* Fixed crash when loading plugin config
* Fixed plugin config not saving properly
* Fixed `\` not being treated as a directory separator
* Fixed `/\.{3,}/` not being treated the same as `.`
* Fixed `fs.getCapacity` in standards mode
* Rewrote abort timeout handling to no longer use debug hooks
* Changed `size_t` size in binary Lua chunks to 4 bytes for compatibility
* Added `lua_externalerror` to throw errors from another thread
* Improved performance of internal string split function
