  * Install the [CraftOS-PC extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jackmacwindows.craftos-pc) to use the debugger
* Added basic generic peripheral emulation
  * New peripheral types: `chest`/`minecraft:chest` (`inventory`), `tank` (`fluid_storage`), `energy` (`energy_storage`)

  * See the full documentation for more info
* Rewrote filesystem code to use C++17 filesystem library
* Added ability to resize monitors programmatically, including by block size (#261)
